                                    We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
                                    safeguard and help prevent unauthorised access to your information and to maintain
                                    data security. These safeguards take into account the sensitivity of the information
                                    that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. We follow
                                    generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted
                                    to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, including the use of vault
                                    and tokenization services from third party service providers. The third party
                                    service providers with respect to our vault and tokenization services and also our

                                    device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive
